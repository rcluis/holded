The project is split in two folders client and backend. Each one has its readme to know how to run the app.

##Considerations

- I used different collections for companies and users because of the limit size of 4mb for each collection, so I case we have a lot of users inside a company this would be a limitation.

## What would I have done if I had more time

- For sure TESTING. I would test both client and backend part. The routes in the backend, then some of the functionality of the react components.
- Add i18n in order to make the app multi-language
- Add profile image limit size.
- Add limits to the form fields in order to not have long name, email, etc
- Add babel async/await plugin in order to make async/await working for IE
- Better design for mobile
